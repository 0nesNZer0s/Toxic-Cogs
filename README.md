Cogs for Red - Discord Bot by TwentySix.

## Information

The Toxic-Cogs repo holds cogs that provide some fun in Discord, while also providing tools for figuring out the status of a website/company and the stats on commands used with the bot.  In addition, there is also a cog that will return the hex/rgb/hsl value of a value that is passed to it, which can be either the name of a color or a hex/rgb/hsl value.  Finally, there is an sql cog to help with the storing of data, and settings for tables to make sure no one without permissions can view or edit the table.

## How to install

These cogs are made for Red V3 by TwentySix, which you can find here (https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).  Using Red V3, you can add my repo by doing `[p]repo add Toxic-Cogs https://github.com/NeuroAssassin/Toxic-Cogs master`, then using `[p]cog install Toxic-Cogs <cog-name>`

## Credits

Credit to https://outage.report/ which allows me to figure out whether websites/companies are down.
Credit to Aikaterna's chatchart cog, which I based my commandchart cog off of (which was also a requested cog on cogboard.red.  Want a cog made for you?  Submit a request on there.).  You can find that cog here: https://github.com/aikaterna/aikaterna-cogs/tree/v3/chatchart
