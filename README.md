# Toxic-Cogs
Cogs for Red - Discord Bot by TwentySix.

The Toxic-Cogs repo holds cogs that provide some fun in Discord, while also providing a tool for figuring out the status of a website/company.

These cogs are made for Red V3 by TwentySix, where you can find here (https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).  Using Red V3, you can add my repo by doing `[p]repo add Toxic-Cogs https://github.com/NeuroAssassin/Toxic-Cogs master`, then using `[p]cog install Toxic-Cogs <cog-name>`

Credit to https://outage.report/ which allows me to figure out whether websites/companies are down.
