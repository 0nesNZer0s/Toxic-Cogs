    "install_msg" : "Thank you for downloading this cog.\n\nHere are some tips for using this cog:\n  - You can store data in the bot's memory (which is emptied every bot shutdown or reload of the cog) or in a file specific to your server.  Note, however, that if you store data in the bot's memory, other server owners can edit it.  However, they cannot edit anything in your server's file.\n  - Server owners can run the `[p]sql execute` command, but using the predefined shortcut commands are better, as they interact with table settings.\n  - When creating a table, you can set settings for it so that you can control who can view or edit the data.  For this, you must provide the id of the role for each.  Use `[p]help sql create` to see how to structure the arguments.\n  - The argument 'space' refers to whether you want to store it in the bot's memory or the file.  If you want memory, type 'mem' for the argument, for the file, type 'file'.\n\nThose are the basics of using this cog, and some important tips.  Hope this turns out to help you.\n\n**Warning:** Due to some problems with downloader, this cog will not load.
